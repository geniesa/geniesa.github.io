        <h1>What I can do.</h1>
        <p>I've been working on content, communications, and marketing-related stuff for the last decade. I like avoiding empty rhreotric and making things as simple — and sustainable — as possible.</p>
        <!-- Em dash count so far: one -->
        <p>My preferences tend to lean in that general direction of not-making-society-more-crappy, and I’m privileged enough to be able to continue taking on projects of that nature. I like solving problems and think that a job well done involves an original state of a thing being improved, clarified, and evolved into something unexpectedly pleasant.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Content for digital products</h2>
        <p>I’ve been on web development and migration projects as a content lead, where I practice content design, strategy, and auditing. A lot of my day jobs have also involved keeping web content well-maintained. I’ve put the following to good use: plain language, digital accessibility, WCAG standards, UX writing, and microcopy.</p>

        <h2>Copywriting and communications</h2>
        <p>I write, edit and proofread for most mediums, online and offline. My words have appeared in academic journals, strategy documents, internal communications, speeches, funding proposals/bids, press releases, social media for very hip youths, social media for the tragically unhip, radio for those of uncertain hipness levels, generic news stories, and more.
        <!-- Quality *and* quantity! -->
        <!-- Also, air horn moment: all of those speeches have been for white men, which is something that I very much am not IMPOSTOR SYNDROME MIC DROP. -->
        I am used to working in Agile sprints and live by deadlines, so I can also get stuff done on time.
        </p>
        <!-- That’s right. I know what YOU know is important. -->

        <p>I like working with domain-specific subject matter expert(s) and can bring things to life with the right personality and tone. I can also write your styleguide.</p>
        <!-- I’ll even let you take your stance on the Oxford Comma. -->


        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>… with people (interviews, focus groups, card sorting, tree testing, surveys and questionnaires), or without people (reading, extreme Googling, digging through documents, compiling reports and literature reviews, interpreting data, academic-spec stuff). I’m also very much for backing up a content strategy or your digital product with user research.</p>

        <h2>The whole shebang</h2>
        <!-- FUN FACT: within a Unix operating system, a shebang looks like this: #! BUT my favourite underused punctuation mark is still the interrobang, which was invented because some fella didn’t like the look of multiple separate exclamation points. A shebang is also a Ricky Martin single turned into some insane hit by guy on American Idol. There was a very good Invisibilia episode about him. LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE STUPID FACTS YOU CRAZY KIDS. -->

        <p>I understand the lifecycle of online and offline projects and can contribute to many parts of it — from concept/discovery and understanding what users want, to writing copy/content design/visual design, and launching a final version of a product/getting things print-ready. I can also recommend ways to keep costs down throughout the process, financially, environmentally, and for the sake of all our energy levels.</p>
        <!-- Yes, I know what you’re thinking: I do it all, like Tommy Wiseau. Exactly. Oh hi Mark!!! -->
        <!-- I’ve already lost count of the em dashes. -->

        <h2>Visual communications</h2>
        <p>If completely necessary, I am capable of visual design, illustration and some photography, for print and web. I can also make gifs and memes, but the internet is known to provide that stuff for free.</p>
        <!-- Awkward, but I may also need your Creative Cloud login details. -->

        <h2>Software</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>CMSes: Silverstripe, Drupal, Contentful, Adobe Experience Manager, Webflow, Sanity, Wordpress, and... most of them, really.</li>
            <li>Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator)</li>
            <li>Design prototyping software (Figma, Adobe XD)</li>
            <li>Google Analytics and Google Search Console</li>
            <li>Software languages: HTML, CSS, some Java and JavaScript, amateur-level Python</li>
            <li>Other stuff: Visual Studio Code, BugHerd, Scrivener, Gather Content, Airtable, Final Draft</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thing is... I won’t claim that I can code up a wicked beautiful thing or even portions of a wicked beautiful thing without crying in my sleep, but I can understand programming logic and good UX principles, am a relatively competent troubleshooter, and know the building blocks of most common digital products.</p>
        <!-- Also, Words with Friends. -->

        <h2>A list of definitely important skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I play guitar, bass, ukulele, piano (poorly), and drums, so I can replace the most unreliable person in your office band.</li>            
            <li>My top votes for Bird of the Year have always eventually been named the year's Bird of the Year for at least five years in a row.</li>           
            <!-- I will not comment on Penguin of the Year. -->
            <li>Most importantly, I will polish off leftover food on the catering table. This is part of my whole sustainability thing. I also have no dietary requirements and have judged more than one office bake-off. This state is possibly me at my most powerful. </li>

            <h2>Digital content</h2>
            <p>I’ve been involved with web overhauls as a digital content lead, working on stuff like content strategy, content design, web audits, comments on UI/UX, user research, and written words. When I’m not spending time on projects of that scale, I tackle individual pages, sites, tools, apps, style guides, or whatever. A lot of my work also involves rewriting things with the user and accessibility in mind.</p>

            <strong>Web migration and redevelopments</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Leading the content redesign and refresh of <a href="http://alcohol.org.nz">alcohol.org.nz</a> to align with its new audience, campaign, and goals.</li>
                <li>Leading the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering.html">Faculty of Engineering</a> as part of the University of Auckland's Web Presence Improvement Programme.

                <li>I wrote and edited the web copy for <a href="https://quitstrong.nz/kuini">a landing page for Kuīni</a>, a chatbot aimed at helping wāhine Māori quit smoking.</li>
                <li>For six years, I’ve written almost all the copy, headlines, microcopy, buttons, and more for the University of Auckland’s <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering.html">Faculty of Engineering</a>. This includes that first time I switched all the headings and buttons for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913014106/https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering.html">Māori Language Week</a>.</li>

                <li>I was also the writer behind a lot of the dense <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option.html?programmeFaculty=engineering&_charset_=UTF-8#list">study and programme information</a> for Engineering.

            In every instance, I’ve had to pitch or propose a story, figure out its angle and format,  interview (and sometimes photograph) the folks involved, listen to my own stupid voice while transcribing, and write all the things.</p>

                    and most of the student interviews. In 2018, I changed its formula to focus on research. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qkgdMseSD-apU12bwlGYgoPGH3qdsRVI/view?usp=sharing">This link is of the original version</a> and what it became <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/172BvRSknolSrHAB0QWgLyHGIkhd9_FnJ/view?usp=sharing">in 2018</a>. Feedback was unanimously positive, including a Deputy Vice-Chancellor saying that it <i>“looks really really fantastic. It looks so different, and it’s pitched beautifully.”</i> It became the template for prospectuses to come university-wide for the next few years.</li>
                    <li>I was given <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fhjZr9yg83NTA2P3O2o2vZuMlzUVD-kR/view?usp=sharing">a folded A3 brochure</a> to “update” but instead of just fixing the copy I decided to trash and redo the whole thing. The point was to have an “at a glance” document instead of another prospectus so I made it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q9RwohspEYUpol4bAY17P8JcojETx27v/view?usp=sharing">a single-page thing</a>.</li>

                    <li>I very quickly designed and wrote copy for some <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Aj-qQOCgSwfkYjTore6r1ZcyBHzVnTk/view?usp=sharing/">brochures, flyers, and business cards</a> for the New Zealand Space Institute for their international spacething conference with the New Zealand Space Agency.</li>
                    <li>I designed and illustrated some books for User Friendly Resources. <a href="https://userfriendlyresources.co.nz/product/speak-easy/">This is one of them</a>. <a href="https://userfriendlyresources.co.nz/product/the-ready-to-read-again-workbook-magenta-to-gold-2007-2015/">Another one</a>. There are more, but I assume their keyword search works or something and all my stuff was just more of the same sort of thing.</li>
                    <!-- It’s a living! -->
                    <li>I refreshed the design and layout of the Canterbury Food and Wine Trail prospectus. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k39fcczbS1iY8XB4FkcsWs8JxtU0Tejl/view?usp=sharing">The original/previous version</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HFhaN2tcONHtuWkvgoZo1HsqTKS6ATJR/view?usp=sharing">the new, condensed version</a> I made.</li>

            <strong>Garbage on GitHub</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>When my flatmates caught COVID-19 and I was barred from leaving the apartment for a week, I turned my personal list of stupid band names into a spreadsheet, which turned into <a href="http://geniesa.github.io/bandter/">a stupid band name generator</a> later that night.

                <li><a href="http://geniesa.github.io/spreadyourlegsnotthevirus">A very important PSA</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Silly stuff elsewhere</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I spent around an hour writing some copy/puns for friends at <a href="https://www.gardenfactory.co.nz">The Garden Factory</a>.</li>
                <li>As the main communications/hype person on faculty for our Discovery Channel-featured BattleBot, I did two very important publicity interviews: <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2018/05/10/meet-our-battlebot.html">the introduction</a>, and <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2021/04/07/our-battlebots-champion.html">the return</a>.</li>
                <li>I wrote copy for fortune cookies. They were all weird research-related jokes. I’m not sure how well they went down because when we ran out of (hundreds of) fortune cookies, they insisted on switching to bags of jet planes and I was only allowed one singular pun. Here are some <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/197Dt3OailMCVlG1aLAE23ttUEvo-TfM6/view?usp=sharing">photos of those terrible treats</a>.</li>
                <li>This isn’t so much about writing but I’m very proud of this <a href="https://twitter.com/UoAEngineering/status/1397341513873432581">robot homage to The Sopranos</a> that I filmed and edited for a Twitter post.</li>

        <h3>No, I did not forget about me promising pictures of koalas.</h3>
        <p>Koalas are kinda jerks though. I mean, I’m not really going to spend a bunch of space bagging on koalas.
        </p>
        <p><button class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-sm" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#buttonKoala" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="buttonKoala" aria-labelledby="Push this button if you really want a stupid spiel about koalas">Okay, maybe I will.</button></p>

        <!-- Koala bullshit, because koalas are bullshit. -->
        <div class="collapse" id="buttonKoala" aria-labelledby="Sub-section about how dumb koalas are">
        <b>Reasons why koalas are stupid jerks:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>You can’t expect to get any respect if you sleep 18-22 hours a day, unlike <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srMePRL0aIQ">giraffes</a>. SORRY NOT SORRY, KOALAS.</li>
            <!-- Maybe I’m just not an EMPATH. -->

            <li>They have THE WORST dierary requirements, eating only eucalyptus (UNSUSTAINABLE!)... which is poisonous in large amounts. These plants are super oily, hard to eat, and have a natural sedative effect (HOW CONVENIENT!). Their digestive systems have somehow failed at this whole adaptation thing, so koalas remain TOO SENSITIVE to do anything else while their bodies are breaking this stuff down. So they keep crashing like over-tired Sims.</li>
            <!-- They probably wake up all tired, see that they’ve also peed on the floor, and then grumble a bunch. And you’re going to have to fix all those Sims satisfaction meters again. NEVER BE A SIMS GOD FOR KOALAS. -->

            <li>Baby koalas (CUTE? MAYBE.) don’t have the correct sort of awkward gut bacteria to break down eucalyptus, and therefore, the natural way of gaining this is OBVIOUSLY to EAT THEIR MOTHERS’ POOP. It’s not even <i>just</i> any old poop, but some leaky runny variant that involves acquisition via some nuzzling action.</li>
            <!-- Nice, solid immodium nuggets? NO THANKS. -->

            <li>When adult koalas can’t digest their eucalyptus, their logical solution is to regurgitate whatever’s in their mouths so they can chew it all over again (SUSTAINABLE, I GUESS!).</li>
            <!-- I’m sure this is a metaphor for the economy or something. -->

            <li>They STILL only eat eucalyptus. ONLY eucalyptus.</li>
            <!-- Jerks. -->

            <li>When they ARE awake, they’re eating more eucalyptus.</li>
            <!-- Go build yourself a eucalyptus cake, you jerk. -->

            <li>They make loud chewy noises when they’re eating said eucalyptus.</li>
            <!-- Ever had to live with somebody who chews so loudly that you can hear it from a separate floor? -->

            <li>They apparently either smell like eucalyptus, even stronger-smelling eucalyptus, or cough drops.</li>
            <!-- Cough drops made of eucalyptus, PROBABLY. -->

            <li>They appear to communicate by screaming demonically.</li>
            <!-- Not even for a cool purpose, like being a magnet for eucalyptus. -->

            <li>They also spend quite a lot of their 2-4 waking hours a day raping each other.</li>
            <!-- Just not okay at all. And also not a valid hobby. -->

            <li>There is enough koala chlamydia to possibly wipe out entire populations.</li>
            <!-- Is this list gross enough yet? -->

            <li>That koala chlamydia can be transmitted to us humans via koala pee.</li>
            <!-- Apparently this list was not gross enough. -->

            <li>They have smooth, singular lumps for brains because eucalyptus doesn’t really contain nutrients.</li>
            <!-- TL;DR: koalas are like a pungent ball with some hair and 3D shapes attached that sleep a ton, rape each other, and spread STIs through their pee. -->

            <li>Their brains are also so tiny and smooth that they’re unable to perform tasks as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxZqVZxPAj4">PAINFULLY COMPLEX</a> as eating their precious eucalyptus leaves from a flat surface.</li>
            <!-- You’d probably read something like this on some clickbait article for "cute animal quirks" or something, but the buildup to this is frankly too stupid to be cute. I’m almost mad at myself for compiling this. -->
        </ul>

        <p>Anyway, I hope that was at least a mildly entertaining diversion and that you now no longer want any pictures of koalas from me. For the record, I’m not genuinely passionate about having an anti-koala stance, but maybe now you’ll know what sort of content belongs on a high-quality webpage.</p>

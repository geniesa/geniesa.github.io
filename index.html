        <!-- We definitely have a paranormal unit to investigate Paranormal Activity. -->

        <p>I also dabble in communications, design, illustration, and things within that digital media genre that are second nature to millennials. Most of my work over the last decade involved transforming complex things into nice, simple storytelling.</p>

          <h1>What I can do.</h1>
          <p>I've been doing content, communications, and marketing-related work for around a decade. I like to avoid empty rhreotric and make things as simple — and sustainable — as possible.
          <!-- Em dash count so far: one -->
          My work preferences tend to lean in that general direction of not-making-society-more-crappy, and I'm privileged enough to be able to continue taking on projects of that nature. I like solving problems and think that a job well done involves an original state of a thing being improved, clarified, and evolved into something unexpectedly pleasant.
          </p>
          <hr>

          <h2>Content and communications</h2>
          <p>I write, edit and proofread for most mediums, online and offline. My words have appeared in academic journals, internal communications, press releases, strategy documents, social media for very hip youths, radio for people who are not very hip youths, generic news stories, speeches, and more.
          <!-- Quality *and* quantity! -->
          <!-- Also, air horn moment: all of those speeches have been for white men, which is something that I very much am not IMPOSTOR SYNDROME MIC DROP. -->
          I can also get stuff done on time.
          </p>
          <!-- That's right. I know what YOU know is important. -->

          <p>I like working with your domain-specific subject matter expert(s) and can bring things to life with the right personality and tone. I can also write your styleguide.</p>
          <!-- I'll even let you take your stance on the Oxford Comma. -->

          <h2>Content for digital products</h2>
          <p>I've been on web development and migration projects as a content lead, and have worked on content design, strategy and auditing. I’ve put the following to good use: plain language, digital accessibility, WCAG standards, UX writing, and microcopy.</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>… with people (focus groups, interviews, surveys and questionnaires), or without people (reading, digging through documents, compiling reports and literature reviews, interpreting data, academic-spec stuff). I’m also very much for backing up a content strategy by getting involved with user research.</p>

          <h2>The whole shebang</h2>
          <!-- FUN FACT: within a Unix operating system, a shebang looks like this: #! BUT my favourite underused punctuation mark is still the interrobang, which was invented because some fella didn't like the look of multiple separate exclamation points. A shebang is also a Ricky Martin single turned into some insane hit by guy on American Idol. There was a very good Invisibilia episode about him. LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE STUPID FACTS YOU CRAZY KIDS. -->

          <p>I understand the lifecycle of online and offline projects and can contribute to many parts of it — from concept/design and understanding what users want, to writing copy, graphic design, and launching a final version of a product/getting things print-ready.</p>
          <!-- Yes, I know what you're thinking: I do it all, like Tommy Wiseau. Exactly. Oh hi Mark!!! -->
          <!-- I've already lost count of the em dashes. -->

          <h2>Visual communications</h2>
          <p>If completely necessary, I've done design, illustration and some photography, for print and web. I can also make gifs and memes, but the internet is known to provide that stuff for free.</p>
          <!-- Awkward, but I may also need your Creative Cloud login details. -->

          <h2>Software</h2>
          <p>Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator), design prototyping software (Figma, Adobe XD), HTML, CSS, some Java and JavaScript, some Python, SEO, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Final Draft, most social media platforms, and most CMSes. Thing is... I won't claim that I can code up a wicked beautiful thing or portions of a wicked beautiful thing without crying in my sleep, but I can understand programming logic, am a relatively competent troubleshooter, and know the building blocks of most common digital products.</p>
          <!-- Also, Words with Friends. -->

          <h2>A list of definitely important skills</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I play guitar, bass, ukulele, piano (poorly), and drums, so I can replace the most unreliable person in your office band.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I will polish off leftover food on the catering table. This is part of my whole sustainability thing. I also have no dietary requirements and have judged more than one office bake-off. This state is possibly me at my most powerful. </li>

                <li>I very quickly wrote some copy and puns for the friends at <a href="https://www.gardenfactory.co.nz">The Garden Factory</a>.</li>
                <li>As the main communications/hype person on faculty for our Discovery Channel-featured BattleBot, I did two very important publicity interviews: <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2018/05/10/meet-our-battlebot.html">the introduction</a>, and <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2021/04/07/our-battlebots-champion.html">the return</a>.</li>
                <li>I wrote copy for fortune cookies. They were all weird research-related jokes. I'm not sure how well they went down because when we ran out of (hundreds of) fortune cookies, they insisted on switching to bags of jet planes and I was only allowed one singular pun. Here are some <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/197Dt3OailMCVlG1aLAE23ttUEvo-TfM6/view?usp=sharing">photos of those terrible treats</a>.</li>

              <h2>Web.</h2>
              <p>This is where I put the projects that involved more technical brain stuff than just 'writing'.</p>

              <strong>Web Presence Improvement Programme</strong>
              <p>In 2017, the University of Auckland funded this programme in response to a longtime need for a new, accessible, mobile-first, user-centered website. I was the Faculty of Engineering's lead
              <!-- Lead and person who did everyfrackingthing, tbh. -->
              and <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering.html">the current website</a> is (still) representative of most of the work that was done.</p>

              Some specifics that happened along the way:
              <ul>
                <li>I audited the entire suite of faculty websites: there were seven separate websites associated with Engineering, including five departments, which was condensed to one single source of truth.</li>
                <!-- If not truth, then definitely TRUTHINESS. -->
                <li>... which meant thousands of pages became approximately 200 pages by the time the new site was launched.</li>
                <li>There was a lot of working with people within faculty to figure out their needs, and being in user testing sessions to figure out more people's needs.</li>
                <li>I was part of a wider Agile team to migrate and rewrite strategy-focused web content. All the rewritten content aligned with new user personas and stories.</li>
                <!-- Correction: "award-winning Agile team". -->
                <li>A couple of us worked overall IA for all faculties, and I came up with the structure for the 'news' frontpage that was adopted by everyone else.</li>
                <li>Engineering was the first of ten faculties in the university to fully launch a brand new website.</li>
                <!-- TAKE THAT, EVERYONE ELSE. But also, web migrations for large institutions are a big, MEAN handful. As of late 2021, some faculties were still lagging behind. -->
                <li>I also presented the successful launch to the university’s senior leadership team, which was not terrifying at all</li>
                <!-- I wasn't incredibly sweaty at all. -->
              </ul>

              <strong>Auckland Programme for Space Systems</strong>
              <p>I was part of a team of three people scraping our way through this brand new initiative in 2016. 
              <!-- The story I tell usually sounds like "this wacky old guy just wants to go to space..." -->
              There are many horrifying anecdotes including how we came up with the name, how we publicised all this stuff internally with no money, and basically a lot of making it up as we go along. I was the self-proclaimed communications director and alogside making up the entire programme's lineup of printed material 
              <!-- Like certificates that looked cooler than all our diplomas. -->
              with zero turnover time, I also designed, built, and wrote copy for <a href="http://apss.auckland.ac.nz">the APSS website</a>.</p>

              <p>This programme is still going strong. 
              <!-- Miracles DO happen. -->
              It attracts over 200 undergraduates each semester who participate for no academic credit. Some students went off to create their own space-related startups. It also became the thing that throttled the university's involvement in the nationwide space agency. The university now offers several postgraduate study options in aerospace engineering (which I had to write copy for). We also launched country’s first-ever university satellite into space in <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/flight-16/">November 2020</a>.</p>
              <!-- 1) yes, we were overshadowed by A GNOME, 2) we don't have to talk about what happened to our satellite. -->

              <strong>Engineering course viewer</strong>
              <p>This was one of the final things I've pushed through before leaving faculty, so time was a constraint. There has been a demand for digital course outlines for years. While the university has finally provided that in early 2021, it still didn't fulfill the needs of students and those guiding them in person. This usually involves showing a very confused student a list of tables full of courses that they can and cannot take.</p>
              <p>The people wanted their tables and exact information, so I assembled a team of two academics. One guy provided the admin and user need, the other programmed the data scraping parts on Python over a weekend. I taught a software engineering lecturer BootStrap and we threw <a href="https://uoaengineering.github.io/courseviewer/">the course viewer</a> together in two weeks. It isn't super pretty, but it works.</p>
              <!-- P.s. Thanks, GitHub! -->

              <strong>Web migrations and redesigns</strong>
              <p>Here's a small sample of websites I've been involved in auditing, shifting, leading, and designing:</p>

              <h2>Print audits and refreshes.</h2>
              <p>Overhauling legacy publications at a large, unchanging institution is no easy feat. A lot of it involves messing with tradition and pushing for change – from which (usually underrepresented) faces and voices you feature, to overall strategy and messaging.
              <!-- By the way, I know this is very liberal arts of me but I've definitely worked with people within the same team who freaked out over the "LACK" of WHITE FACES in our publications. In like, 2016. And I'm more than happy to NARK if we ever chat about these things in person. -->
              The following are some things where I've been involved with at every stage of the production: concept, copy, design, and getting them set up to be printed.</p>

              <strong>Undergraduate flyers</strong>
              <p>The state of undergraduate promotional publications in 2015 or so was a mess for a faculty that wants to show off a consistent front. Each department kinda made up their own variants, so everyone had different copy, design, and formatting. Many of these <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/172BvRSknolSrHAB0QWgLyHGIkhd9_FnJ/view?usp=sharing">undergraduate flyers</a> were double-sided A4 things folded into three. At their worst they were printed on NORMAL PAPER in someone's office.</p>

              <p>My job was to take over and figure out what to do with each one
              <!-- As the IRON FIST OF MARKETING, obviously. -->
              of our five departments and nine specialisations. I took time planning, writing, and prioritising what individual people with their individual opinions wanted to tell their audience. I then created a template for everybody, and we stuck to a single format to keep things looking unified. 
              <!-- That's fancy talk for 'a word document with big highlighted headings in them'. -->
              We got reuse fun textural shots that always came in sets of our photoshoots and didn't have a purpose until then. Pepople were not mad and other marketing folks were impressed and wanted to copy them. That was good. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/172BvRSknolSrHAB0QWgLyHGIkhd9_FnJ/view?usp=sharing">PDF of the befores and afters</a>.</p>

              <strong>Postgraduate prospectus</strong>
              <p>I had full reign of all our faculty prospectuses (new undergraduate and postgraduate ones are published every year)
              <!-- I super duper agree that this is SUPER WASTEFUL, by the way. --> 
              from 2018 to 2021 and have written every piece of copy, including the Dean's messages 
              <!-- When I say I've been writing on behalf of old white men for a long time... -->
              and most of the student interviews. In 2018, I decided to fully change the postgraduate edition and decided to showcase research, because it aligned with the audience and we were good at that.
              <!-- Let's not focus on what we are not so good at. -->
              Here's <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qkgdMseSD-apU12bwlGYgoPGH3qdsRVI/view?usp=sharing">the original version</a> and what it became <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/172BvRSknolSrHAB0QWgLyHGIkhd9_FnJ/view?usp=sharing">in 2018</a>.</p>
              <p>The feedback was unanimously positive, including a Deputy Vice-Chancellor saying that it <i>“looks really, really fantastic. You must be really pleased with your work? It looks so different, and it’s pitched beautifully.”</i> It became sort of the template for prospectuses to come university-wide
              <!-- Basically, everybody had to follow ME, which must've sucked for like, nine faculties. -->
              in 2021, but uh, a pandemic happened.</p>

              <strong>Postgraduate flyer</strong>
              <p>In 2016, I was given <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fhjZr9yg83NTA2P3O2o2vZuMlzUVD-kR/view?usp=sharing">an existing folded A3 brochure</a> to "update" but instead of just fixing the copy I decided to trash and redo the whole thing. The point was to have an "at a glance" document instead of a mini prospectus I modernised it with infographics, which was pretty modern for that time. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q9RwohspEYUpol4bAY17P8JcojETx27v/view?usp=sharing">It looks modern</a>, I guess.</p>

                <li>Some of my guys got invited to some big time space conference overseas with the NZ Space Agency so I had to whip up some print marketing in a jiffy. I followed most of the university style guide and also wrote all the copy. I had to do all of this in a super short amount of time but imagining these people lugging piles of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Aj-qQOCgSwfkYjTore6r1ZcyBHzVnTk/view?usp=sharing/">brochures, flyers, and business cards</a> brought me some satisfaction.</li>
                <!-- Because they can totally be WEAK, geddit?! -->
                <li>I worked together with our employment relations manager to write and design this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14KjshYYVQFlYamk0_RTddsBCAORsVHnb/view?usp=sharing">foldy foldy brochure</a> so that businesses would poach our interns. Unfortunately there's no photo of it in action aside for this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w72gRPO4AmbwucwlR5ugJpRrOiyasbuG/view?usp=sharing">photo of it sitting passively</a> but it's actually quite cool and I worked with a printer to make sure that people can stick their business cards inside it.</li>
                <li>I designed and illustrated some books for User Friendly Resources. <a href="https://userfriendlyresources.co.nz/product/speak-easy/">This link is one of them</a>. <a href="https://userfriendlyresources.co.nz/product/the-ready-to-read-again-workbook-magenta-to-gold-2007-2015/">Another one</a>. There are more, but I assume their keyword search works or something and all my stuff was more of the same sort of thing.</li>
                <li>I refreshed the design and layout of the Canterbury Food and Wine Trail prospectus. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k39fcczbS1iY8XB4FkcsWs8JxtU0Tejl/view?usp=sharing">The original/previous version</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HFhaN2tcONHtuWkvgoZo1HsqTKS6ATJR/view?usp=sharing">the new, condensed version</a> I made.</li>

                <li>Way back in some ancient time, I designed the logo and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ma7_9d9AbLecDLlUvhBt8g7CcJuD2St6/view?usp=sharing">series of posters</a> for panel talks at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/womensfutures">Women's Futures Month</a>.</li>

Their digestive systems have somehow failed at this whole adaptation thing, so koalas remain TOO SENSITIVE to do anything else while their bodies are breaking this stuff down. So they keep crashing like over-tired Sims.</li>
              <!-- They probably wake up all tired, see that they've also peed on the floor, and then grumble a bunch. And you're going to have to fix all those Sims satisfaction meters again. NEVER BE A SIMS GOD FOR KOALAS. -->

              <li>Baby koalas (CUTE? MAYBE.) don't have the correct sort of awkward gut bacteria to break down eucalyptus, and therefore, the natural way of gaining this is OBVIOUSLY to EAT THEIR MOTHERS' POOP. It's not even <i>just</i> any old poop, but some leaky runny variant that involves acquisition via some nuzzling action.</li>
              <!-- Nice, solid immodium nuggets? NO THANKS. -->

              <li>When adult koalas can't digest their eucalyptus, their logical solution is to regurgitate whatever's in their mouths so they can chew it all over again (SUSTAINABLE, I GUESS!).</li>
              <!-- I'm sure this is a metaphor for the economy or something. -->

              <li>They STILL only eat eucalyptus. ONLY eucalyptus.</li>
              <!-- Jerks. -->

              <li>When they ARE awake, they're eating more eucalyptus.</li>
              <!-- Go build yourself a eucalyptus cake, you jerk. -->

              <li>They make loud chewy noises when they're eating said eucalyptus.</li>
              <!-- Ever had to live with somebody who chews so loudly that you can hear it from a separate floor? -->

              <li>They apparently either smell like eucalyptus, even stronger-smelling eucalyptus, or cough drops.</li>
              <!-- Cough drops made of eucalyptus, PROBABLY. -->

              <li>They appear to communicate by screaming demonically.</li>
              <!-- Not even for a cool purpose, like being a magnet for eucalyptus. -->

              <li>They also spend quite a lot of their 2-4 waking hours a day raping each other.</li>
              <!-- Just not okay at all. And also not a valid hobby. -->

              <li>There is enough koala chlamydia to possibly wipe out entire populations.</li>
              <!-- Is this list gross enough yet? -->

              <li>That koala chlamydia can be transmitted to us humans via koala pee.</li>
              <!-- Apparently this list was not gross enough. -->

              <li>They have smooth, singular lumps for brains because eucalyptus doesn't really contain nutrients.</li>
              <!-- TL;DR: koalas are like a pungent ball with some hair and 3D shapes attached that sleep a ton, rape each other, and spread STIs through their pee. -->

              <li>Their brains are also so tiny and smooth that they're unable to perform tasks as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxZqVZxPAj4">PAINFULLY COMPLEX</a> as eating their precious eucalyptus leaves from a flat surface.</li>
              <!-- You'd probably read something like this on some clickbait article for "cute animal quirks" or something, but the buildup to this is frankly too stupid to be cute. I'm almost mad at myself for compiling this. -->
            </ul>

            <p>Anyway, I hope that was at least a mildly entertaining diversion and that you now no longer want any pictures of koalas from me. For the record, I'm not genuinely passionate about having an anti-koala stance, but maybe now you'll know what sort of content belongs on a high-quality webpage.</p>

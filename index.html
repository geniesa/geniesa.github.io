<h2>Here's the super direct pitch. No pressure, me.</h2>
<p>I've been doing content-related things for around a decade. My take on work, process, and everything else is to avoid empty rhreotric and make things as inhumanly simple — and sustainable — as possible.</p>

<!-- Speaking of sustainability, the initial thought here was to shove everything on one webpage, with just one code file.
Don't hold me to it, but it's working out okay, though at the time of writing this comment, I have yet to include samples of my work. That's the final piece of this whole shebang. And maybe there'd be fewer lines if I didn't spend so much damn time rambling about koalas. -->


<p>Here's the generic list of things I can do that'll make me rad at a job:</p>
    <p><button class="btn btn-outline-info btn-sm" type="button" data-toggle= "collapse" data-target="#buttonSkills" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="buttonSkills">
        Skills!</button></p>
      <div class="border border-info p-3 collapse" id="buttonSkills">
      <ul>
          <li>I can write a <i>lot</i>, in Plain English, for most mediums, online and offline. My words have appeared in academic journals, internal communications, press releases, strategy documents, social media for hip youths, generic news stories, speeches, and more. Quality <i>and</i> quantity!</li>
          <li>Graphic design and illustration, for print and web. I can also make gifs and memes, but the internet is known to provide that stuff for free.</li>
          <li>I can handle full-scale projects on both print and web — from conceptualizing a thing, to the writing and design, and launching a final version of a site/getting it all print-ready... all by my lonesome, like a parody of a one-woman band.</li>
          <li>I used to grade university-level papers for money, so my editing and proofreading skills are pretty up to scratch.</li>
          <li>Research: with people (focus groups or interviews), or without people (reading, digging through documents, compiling reports, translating data, academic-spec stuff).</li>
          <li>Web architecture and migration projects, including content auditing.</li>
          <li>More recently, I've been learning more about content strategy and design, as well as getting into the web accessibility game — because accessible content is awesome for everyone — and applying good practice wherever I can.</li>
          <li><b>Technical stuff:</b> The Adobe Creative Suite (usually Photoshop, InDesign and/or Illustrator), HTML, CSS, some Java and JavaScript, some Python, SEO, Google Analytics, Final Draft, most social media platforms, and most CMSes.</li>
      </ul>
       <p>Definitely also skills:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>I play guitar, bass, ukulele, bad piano, and drums, so I can replace the most unreliable person in your office band.</li>
          <li>Most importantly, I will polish off leftover food on the catering table. This is part of my whole sustainability thing. I also have no dietary requirements and have judged more than one office bake-off. This is possibly my most powerful skill. </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
     <br>
     <p>I like solving problems and learning along the way, so challenging stuff — like translating dense information into something that common people would enjoy, science communication, or applying the right personality and tone to content in need of life — do bring me some form of joy. I think a job well done involves an original state of a thing being improved, clarified, and evolved into something unexpectedly pleasant.</p>
     <p>Leave me with your out-of-the-box projects. And also the projects inside the box waiting to be released via some form of creative coaxing, Scooby Doo voodoo shenanigans, or good, brutal editing. I'll find some way to make anything fun (at least for myself) somehow.</p>
     <p>I won't <i>not</i> consider more pro-bono work, just like I also probably won't not write in double negatives.</p>

  There's a story behind this.</button></p>
  <div class="border border-info p-3 collapse" id="theThesis">
  <p>I was stupid enough to keep up with the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LMeaRYb.png">scholarly life</a> in spite of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Canterbury_earthquake">that pretty drastic thing that happened to the city I was living in</a>. Anyway, the other stupid thing is that nobody was writing about memes at the time (a rational person would probably say, "who would?!") so I was probably being less scholarly, and more trying to get The Daily Show or The Colbert Report to hire me (spoiler: neither of them did that).</p>
  <p>Anyway, pop culture is extremely valid and fun to study for realsies, and I've somehow underestimated what memes can become, so follow those meme dreams, kids, even if your parents are never going to read that thesis. My idiocy has since been rewarded with a bunch of citations, getting <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cE5HSmT.jpg">quoted in an actual scholarly book about Star Wars</a> (which makes me assume that George Lucas owes me a drink now), convincing someone to accept my garbage as <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7592/EJHR2014.2.4.tay">a journal article</a>, and scoring a whopping <i>h-index</i> of TWO, so, uh, it is what it is. You can find the thesis on <a href="https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/7091">the University of Canterbury's library website</a>. If clicking on a hyperlink is not your style, I also included "best thesis ever" as keywords.</p>

<h2>No, I did not forget about me promising pictures of koalas.</h2>
<p>Koalas are kind of stupid jerks though. I mean, I'm not really going to spend all this space bagging on koalas.</p>
<p><button class="btn btn-outline-info btn-sm" type="button" data-toggle= "collapse" data-target="#buttonKoala" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="buttonKoala">
Okay, maybe I will.</button></p>
<!-- koala bullshit-->
<div class="border border-info p-3 collapse" id="buttonKoala">
    <b>Reasons why koalas are stupid jerks:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>You can't expect to get any respect if you sleep 18-22 hours a day, unlike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srMePRL0aIQ">giraffes</a>. Sorry, koalas. That's just not good empathy material.</li>
    <li>They have worse dietary requirements than anyone you'll ever meet, eating only eucalyptus, which are poisonous in large amounts. These plants are super oily, hard to eat, and have a natural sedative effect. Koalas' digestive systems have somehow failed at this whole adaptation thing (aside for the 'only eats one thing to live' part), and remain TOO SENSITIVE to do anything else while breaking this stuff down, so they keep crashing like over-tired Sims.</li>
    <li>Baby koalas don't have this awkward gut bacteria that breaks down eucalyptus, and therefore, the natural way of gaining this is OBVIOUSLY to EAT THEIR MOTHERS' POOP. It's not even <i>just</i> any old poop, but some leaky runny variant that involves acquisition via some nuzzling action.</li>
    <li>When adult koalas can't digest their eucalyptus, their logical solution is to regurgitate whatever's in their mouths so they can chew it all over again. Classy.</li>
    <li>AND YET, they eat eucalyptus and ONLY eucalyptus in spite of this whole toxicity thing, AND the fact that this makes them unproductive members of society.</li>
    <li>When they ARE awake, they're eating more eucalyptus.</li>
    <li>They make loud chewy noises when they're eating said eucalyptus.</li>
    <li>They apparently either smell like eucalyptus, even stronger-smelling eucalyptus, or cough drops.</li>
    <li>They appear to communicate by screaming demonically.</li>
    <li>They also spend quite a lot of their 2-4 waking hours a day raping each other.</li>
    <li>Koala chlamydia. Lots of it. Enough koala chlamydia to possibly wipe out entire populations.</li>
    <li>That koala chlamydia can be transmitted to us humans via koala pee.</li>
    <li>They have smooth, singular lumps for brains because eucalyptus doesn't really contain nutrients.</li>
    <li>They also have extremely tiny brains.</li>
    <li>Their brains are so tiny and smooth that they're unable to perform tasks as <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxZqVZxPAj4">COMPLEX</a> as eating their precious eucalyptus leaves from a flat surface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Anyway, I hope that was at least a mildly entertaining diversion and you now no longer want any pictures of koalas from me. For the record, I'm not inherently passionate about having an anti-koala stance — don't even get me started on how stupid kiwi are. Just keep voting for the kea, kererū, or kakapo as <a href="https://www.birdoftheyear.org.nz/">Bird of the Year</a>.</p>

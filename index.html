        <p class="lead">I'm a content writer, mostly. Sometimes I even get paid to do that stuff.
        <p>These days, I'm based in Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
        <!-- We definitely have a paranormal unit to investigate Paranormal Activity. -->

        <p>Sometimes I dabble in design, illustration, and the general digital media-type stuff that are second nature
          to millennials. Most of my work over the last decade has involved transforming some complex thing into nice,
          simple storytelling.</p>
        <!-- The thing also known as "that thing I'd rather consume instead of that horrible complex thing." -->

        <!-- I also get very sad when people misuse and abuse the em dash. -->

          <h1>What I can do.</h1>
          <p>I've been doing content, communications, and marketing-related work for around a decade. My take on the
            working process, results, and everything else is to avoid empty rhreotric and make things as inhumanly
            simple — and sustainable — as possible.
            <!-- Em dash count so far: one -->
            I like solving problems and think that a job well done involves an original state of a thing being improved,
            clarified, and evolved into something unexpectedly pleasant.
          </p>
          <hr>


          <h2>Content and communications</h2>
          <p>I write, edit and proofread for most mediums, online and offline. My words have appeared in academic
            journals, internal communications, press releases, strategy documents, social media for very hip youths,
            radio for people who are not very hip youths, generic news stories, speeches, and more.
            <!-- Quality *and* quantity! -->
            <!-- Also, air horn moment: all of those speeches have been for white men, which is something that I very much am not. IMPOSTOR SYNDROME MIC DROP. -->
            I can also get stuff done on time.
          </p>
          <!-- That's right. I know what YOU know is important. -->

          <p>I like working with domain-specific subject matter expert(s) and can bring things to life with the right
            personality and tone. I can also write your styleguide.</p>
          <!-- I'll even let you decide if you want to accept Oxford Commas. -->

          <h2>Content for digital products</h2>
          <p>I've been on web development and migration projects as a content lead, and have worked on content design,
            strategy and auditing. I’ve put stuff like the following to good use: plain language, digital accessibility,
            UX writing, and microcopy.</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>… with people (focus groups, interviews, surveys and questionnaires), or without people (reading, digging
            through documents, compiling reports, interpreting data, academic-spec stuff). I’m also very much for
            backing up a content strategy with user research.</p>

          <h2>The whole shebang</h2>
          <!-- FUN FACT: within a Unix operating system, a shebang looks like this: #! BUT my favourite underused punctuation mark is still the interrobang, which was invented because some fella didn't like the look of multiple separate exclamation points. A shebang is also a Ricky Martin single turned into some insane hit by guy on American Idol. There was a very good Invisibilia episode about him. LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE STUPID FACTS -->

          <p>I understand the lifecycle of online and offline projects and can contribute to many parts of it — from
            concept/design and understanding what users want, to writing copy, graphic design, and launching a final
            version of a product/getting things print-ready.</p>
          <!-- Yes, I know what you're thinking: like Tommy Wiseau. Exactly. Oh hi Mark!!! -->
          <!-- And yes, there goes another em dash. -->

          <h2>Visual communications</h2>
          <p>If completely necessary, I've done design, illustration and some photography, for print and web. I can also
            make gifs and memes, but the internet is known to provide that stuff for free.</p>
          <!-- Um, I may also need your Creative Cloud login details. -->

          <h2>Software</h2>
          <p>Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator), design prototyping software (Figma, Adobe XD),
            HTML, CSS, some Java and JavaScript, some Python, SEO, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Final Draft,
            most social media platforms, and most CMSes.</p>
          <!-- Also, Words with Friends. -->

          <h2>A list of definitely important skills</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I play guitar, bass, ukulele, piano (poorly), and drums, so I can replace the most unreliable person in
              your office band.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I will polish off leftover food on the catering table. This is part of my whole
              sustainability thing. I also have no dietary requirements and have judged more than one office bake-off.
              This is possibly me at my most powerful. </li>

              <h2>Web.</h2>
              <p>This is where I put the projects that involved more of the technical brain stuff than just 'writing'.
              </p>

              <strong>Web Presence Improvement Programme</strong>
              <p>In 2017, the University of Auckland funded this programme, which responded to a longtime need for a
                new, accessible, mobile-first, user-centered website. I functioned as the Faculty of Engineering's lead
                and <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering.html">the current website</a> is (still) the
                result of a lot of the work. </p>
              Some stuff I've done:
              <ul>
                <li>Audited the suite of faculty websites: there were about seven separate websites associated with us,
                  which we condensed to one single source of truth.</li>
                <li>... which meant thousands of pages became approximately 200.</li>
                <li>Worked with people within faculty to figure out their needs, and sat in user testing sessions to
                  figure out those needs.</li>
                <li>Worked in a wider Agile team to migrate and rewrite strategy-focused web content, all aligned with
                  new user personas and stories.</li>
                <!-- Correction: "award-winning Agile team". -->
                <li>Worked with the content lead on the overall IA and came up with the structure for the 'news'
                  frontpage that was adopted university-wide.</li>
                <li>Was the first of ten faculties in the university to fully launch a brand new website.</li>
                <li>Presented the successful launch to the university’s senior leadership team, which was not terrifying
                  at all.</li>
                <!-- I wasn't extremely sweaty at all. -->
              </ul>

              <strong>Auckland Programme for Space Systems</strong>
              <p>I was part of a team of three people scraping our way through this brand new initiative that a guy just
                made up in 2016. There are many horrifying anecdotes including how we came up with the name, how we
                publicised all this stuff internally with no money, and basically a lot of making it up as we go along.
                I was the self-proclaimed communications director and alogside making up the entire programme's lineup
                of printed stuff with zero turnover time, I also designed, built, and wrote copy for <a
                  href="http://apss.auckland.ac.nz">the APSS website</a>.
              </p>
              <!-- Dumb stuff: I also made certificates that looked cooler than all our diplomas. -->
              <p>This programme is (miraculously) still going strong. It attracts over 200 undergraduates each semester
                who participate for no academic credit. Students went off to create their own startups. It also became
                the thing that throttled the university's involvement in the nationwide space agency. They now offer
                several postgraduate study options in aerospace engineering (which I had to write copy for). We also
                launched country’s first-ever university satellite into space in <a
                  href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/flight-16/">November 2020</a>.
                <!-- 1) yes, we were overshadowed by A GNOME, 2) we don't have to talk about what happened to it. -->
              </p>

              <strong>Engineering course viewer</strong>
              <p>This one's a strange project. It was one of the final things I've done before leaving faculty, so time
                was a constraint. There has been a demand for digital course outlines for years. While the university
                has finally provided that in early 2021, it still didn't fulfill the needs of users and those guiding
                them in person, who'd usually show them a list of tables full of courses they can and cannot take.</p>
              <p>The people wanted their tables and exact information, so I assembled a team of two academics. One guy
                provided the admin and user need, the other coded the thing that dragged information out of a bunch of
                spreadsheets in Python over a weekend. I taught a software engineering lecturer BootStrap and we threw
                <a href="https://uoaengineering.github.io/courseviewer/">the course viewer</a> together in two weeks. It
                isn't super pretty, but it works.
              </p>

              <strong>Web migrations and redesigns</strong>

              <h2>Print audits and refreshes.</h2>
              <p>Overhauling legacy publications at a large, unchanging institution was no easy feat. A lot of it
                involves changing tradition – from which (usually underrepresented) faces and voices you feature, to
                overall strategy and messaging.
                <!-- By the way, I know this is very liberal arts of me but I've definitely worked with people within the same team who freaked out over the "LACK" of WHITE FACES in our publications. And I'm more than happy to NARK if we ever chat about this in person. -->
                The following are some things where I've been involved with at every stage of the production: concept,
                copy, design, and getting them printed.
              </p>

              <strong>Undergraduate flyers</strong>
              <p>The state of undergraduate promotional publications in 2015 or so was a mess for a faculty meant to
                show off a consistent front. Each department kinda made up their own variants, so the copy, design, and
                formats looked really different. Many of these <a
                  href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/172BvRSknolSrHAB0QWgLyHGIkhd9_FnJ/view?usp=sharing">undergraduate
                  flyers</a> were double-sided A4 things folded into three, sometimes printed on normal paper in house.
              </p>

              <p>My job was to take over and figure out what to do with each one:
                <!-- As the IRON FIST OF MARKETING, obviously. -->
                five departments and nine specialisations. It took a lot of time planning, writing, and prioritising
                what individual people with their individual opinions wanted to tell their audience. I ended up creating
                a template for everybody, and we stuck to a single format to keep things looking unified. We got to
                reuse a bunch of photoshoots and some fun textural shots that always didn't have a purpose until now.
                People liked the result. Other marketing folks were impressed and wanted to copy them. That was a good
                result. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/172BvRSknolSrHAB0QWgLyHGIkhd9_FnJ/view?usp=sharing">PDF
                  of the befores and afters</a>.
              </p>

              <strong>Postgraduate prospectus</strong>
              <p>I had full reign of all our faculty prospectuses (new undergraduate and postgraduate ones are published
                every year)
                <!-- I super duper agree that this is SUPER WASTEFUL, by the way. --> from 2018 to 2021 and have written
                every piece of copy, including the Dean's messages and most of the student interviews. In 2018, I did a
                major overhaul of the postgraduate edition and decided to showcase research, because it aligned with the
                audience and we were good at that.
                <!-- Let's not focus on what we are not so good at. -->
                Here's <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qkgdMseSD-apU12bwlGYgoPGH3qdsRVI/view?usp=sharing">the
                  original version</a> and what it became <a
                  href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/172BvRSknolSrHAB0QWgLyHGIkhd9_FnJ/view?usp=sharing">in 2018</a>.
              </p>
              <p>The feedback was unanimously positive, including a Deputy Vice-Chancellor saying that it <i>“looks
                  really, really fantastic. You must be really pleased with your work? It looks so different, and it’s
                  pitched beautifully.”</i> It became sort of the template for prospectuses to come university-wide
                <!-- Basically, everybody had to follow ME, which must've sucked for like, nine faculties. -->
                in 2021, but uh, a pandemic happened.
              </p>

              <strong>Postgraduate flyer</strong>
              <p>In 2016, I was given <a
                  href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fhjZr9yg83NTA2P3O2o2vZuMlzUVD-kR/view?usp=sharing">an existing
                  folded A3 brochure</a> to "update" but instead of just fixing the copy I kinda redid the whole thing.
                The point was to have an "at a glance" document instead of a mini prospectus I modernised it with
                infographics, which was pretty modern for that time. <a
                  href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q9RwohspEYUpol4bAY17P8JcojETx27v/view?usp=sharing">It looks

          <h3>No, I did not forget about me promising pictures of koalas.</h3>
          <p>Koalas are kinda jerks though. I mean, I'm not really going to spend a bunch of space bagging on koalas.
          </p>
          <p><button class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-sm" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#buttonKoala"
              aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="buttonKoala">
              Okay, maybe I will.</button></p>

          <!-- Koala bullshit, because koalas are bullshit. -->
          <div class="collapse" id="buttonKoala">
            <b>Reasons why koalas are stupid jerks:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>You can't expect to get any respect if you sleep 18-22 hours a day, unlike <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srMePRL0aIQ">giraffes</a>. SORRY NOT SORRY, KOALAS.</li>
              <!-- Maybe I'm just not an EMPATH. -->

              <li>They have THE WORST dierary requirements, eating only eucalyptus (UNSUSTAINABLE!)... which are
                poisonous in large amounts. These plants are super oily, hard to eat, and have a natural sedative effect
                (HOW CONVENIENT!). Their digestive systems have somehow failed at this whole adaptation thing, and
                remain TOO SENSITIVE to do anything else while breaking this stuff down, so they keep crashing like
                over-tired Sims.</li>
              <!-- They probably wake up all tired, see that they've also peed on the floor, and grumble a bunch. And you're going to have to fix all those Sims satisfaction meters again. -->

              <li>Baby koalas (CUTE? MAYBE.) don't have the right awkward gut bacteria to break down eucalyptus, and
                therefore, the natural way of gaining this is OBVIOUSLY to EAT THEIR MOTHERS' POOP. It's not even
                <i>just</i> any old poop, but some leaky runny variant that involves acquisition via some nuzzling
                action.
              </li>
              <!-- Do NOT invoke rule 34. -->

              <li>When adult koalas can't digest their eucalyptus, their logical solution is to regurgitate whatever's
                in their mouths so they can chew it all over again (SUSTAINABLE, I GUESS!).</li>
              <!-- I'm sure this is a metaphor for the economy or something. -->

              <li>They STILL only eat eucalyptus. ONLY eucalyptus.</li>
              <!-- Jerks. -->

              <li>When they ARE awake, they're eating more eucalyptus.</li>
              <!-- Go bake yourself a eucalyptus cake, you jerk. -->

              <li>They make loud chewy noises when they're eating said eucalyptus.</li>
              <!-- Ever had to live with somebody who chews so loudly that you can hear it from a separate floor? -->

              <li>They apparently either smell like eucalyptus, even stronger-smelling eucalyptus, or cough drops.</li>
              <!-- Cough drops made of eucalyptus, probably. -->

              <li>They appear to communicate by screaming demonically.</li>
              <!-- Not even for a cool purpose, like being a magnet for eucalyptus. -->

              <li>They also spend quite a lot of their 2-4 waking hours a day raping each other.</li>
              <!-- Just not okay. And not a valid hobby. -->

              <li>There is enough koala chlamydia to possibly wipe out entire populations.</li>
              <!-- Is this list gross enough yet? -->

              <li>That koala chlamydia can be transmitted to us humans via koala pee.</li>
              <!-- Apparently this list was not gross enough. -->

              <li>They have smooth, singular lumps for brains because eucalyptus doesn't really contain nutrients.</li>
              <!-- TL;DR: koalas are like a pungent ball with some hair and 3D shapes attached that sleep a ton, rape each other, and spread STIs through their pee. -->

              <li>Their brains are also so tiny and smooth that they're unable to perform tasks as <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxZqVZxPAj4">PAINFULLY COMPLEX</a> as eating their precious
                eucalyptus leaves from a flat surface.</li>
              <!-- You'd probably read something like this on some clickbait article for "cute animal quirks" or something, but the buildup to this is frankly too stupid to be cute. I'm almost mad at myself for compiling this. -->
            </ul>

            <p>Anyway, I hope that was at least a mildly entertaining diversion and that you now no longer want any
              pictures of koalas from me. For the record, I'm not genuinely passionate about having an anti-koala
              stance, but maybe now you'll know what sort of content belongs on a high-quality webpage.</p>

            negatives but only for fun and not legitimate work because double negatives are terrible for readability.
